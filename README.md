# DB-Proj1

Files Added -

cs4321.project1.Pair.java :

Using Java Generics to write our own "Pair" object
which will be used in the file EvaluatePrefixListVisitor.java
to store values like (+,2),(-,2),(~,1), etc into the Stack

Assumptions -

1. For testing against a divide-by-zero operation in case of tree evaluations, we have updated the result to 0 as an error scenario. 
This situation however will never arise as it is said that all tests will only be done against valid inputs. 
But we added this check anyway, as it felt right.
